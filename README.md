## Methods

### ‚úÖ 3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified
1. [Method 1: Description]
2. [Method 2: Description]
3. Method 3: Integration of Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning
   <p align="justify">
   We aim to utilize machine learning techniques for clustering teams based on playing style, selecting matchups between teams from different clusters, identifying optimal players for a given matchup, and predicting the outcome of the match using historical data. Develop a system by combining unsupervised learning (K-means clustering), supervised learning (Random Forest classifier), and heuristic methods (player selection based on opponent characteristics), which would offer a sophisticated approach to team and player analysis.
   </p>
   
#### Steps:
1. Clustering Teams Based on Playing Style: We will first extract team playing style features from the available dataset, which may include:
   * **Offensive metrics**: Goals scored, shots on target, passing accuracy in the attacking third, etc.
   * **Defensive metrics**: Tackles made, interceptions, clearances, etc.
   * **Possession metrics**: Time in possession, passes completed, and ball retention.
   * **Form**: A measure of the team's performance in recent matches.         
      These features will be normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniformity across different ranges of metrics. After normalizing the data, **K-means clustering** will be applied to group teams into clusters based on their playing style. The clustering result will provide a set of groups where each group (cluster) represents teams with similar playing styles.
     
2. Visualizing Clusters:To visualize the results, we will apply t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to reduce the dimensionality of the playing style features, allowing us to plot teams in a 2D space. Each point will represent a team, and the color will represent its cluster.
3. Selecting Teams to Play Against Each Other: To ensure diversity in matchups, we will randomly select two teams from different clusters. This ensures that teams with varying playing styles are chosen for the simulated match.
4. Finding Best Players Based on Opponent: We will implement a system that identifies the best players for one team based on how well they can counter the playing style of the opposing team. This will involve comparing the playing styles of both teams and identifying which players from the opponent's squad are best suited to exploit the weaknesses of the first team.
  5. Predicting Match Outcome: Using historical match data, we will train a Random Forest classifier to predict the outcome of a match based on the playing styles (clusters) of both teams and their recent form. This will allow us to predict the likely outcome and the probabilities of each team winning.

#### Tools and Technologies:
   - üêç **Python Libraries**: Scikit-learn (for K-means clustering, t-SNE, Random Forest), Pandas, Matplotlib
   - ü§ñ **Machine Learning Algorithms**: K-means clustering, t-SNE for visualization, Random Forest classifier for match prediction
   - üìä **Data**: Team statistics (playing style), player statistics, and historical match data
