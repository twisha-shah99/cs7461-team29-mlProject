# Proposal Sections & Checklist

## Introduction/Background
The application of machine learning in sports analytics has gained significant momentum, offering coaches, analysts, and teams actionable insights to improve performance. In soccer, understanding and optimizing team strategies, player selection, and match outcomes is critical for success. Traditional approaches often rely on subjective judgments, which may lead to suboptimal decisions.

### ‚úÖ Literature Review
- Recent studies have applied machine learning techniques to address challenges in soccer, such as optimizing team strategies and player selection.
- Unsupervised methods, like K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), have been used to cluster teams based on statistical features such as goals and possession, grouping them by similar tactical styles.
- Supervised learning techniques, including Random Forest classifiers, have been employed to predict match outcomes using historical data.
- These approaches help automate the analysis of teams and players, providing data-driven insights to improve team performance by enabling better strategic decisions and more effective player selection for specific matchups.

## Problem Definition

### ‚úÖ Problem
Football teams play using various styles; however, optimizing these strategies and choosing the best players for a particular opponent can be a difficult task. Rather than using a data-driven approach to cluster teams, coaches oftern rely on subjective judgements that an lead to poor team performance in games.

### ‚úÖ Motivation
Automating the analysis of teams to explore the best playing styles can allow teams to make better and strategic decisions. Using unsupervised learning to cluster teams based on tactics and supervised learning to predict match outcomes, this project will provide concrete insights to help teams to best select their players and strategy. This, in turn, will help teams better prepare for their games and enhance their performance in games.

## Methods
Present proposed solutions, including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, elaborating on their effectiveness. Identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.

### ‚úÖ 3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified
1. [Method 1: Description]
2. Method 2: Unsupervised Learning: We aim to utilize unsupervised machine learning algorithms for two main objectives:
   #### 1. Techniques used for: Team Clustering
      
      ##### K-means Clustering:
      - **Apply K-means to group teams based on their playing styles**: Teams are clustered by their statistical features (like goals scored, tackles, and possession), grouping teams with similar tactics into distinct clusters.
      
      - **Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters**: This method identifies the point where adding more clusters provides diminishing returns in reducing within-cluster variance, helping to find the most meaningful number of team groupings.
      
      - **Visualize clusters using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction**: t-SNE projects the high-dimensional team statistics into two dimensions, making it easier to visualize and interpret how teams are grouped by their playing styles.
      
      ##### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):
      - **Implement GMM as an alternative clustering method, allowing for more flexible cluster shapes**: Unlike K-means, GMM allows each team to belong to multiple clusters with different probabilities, accommodating more complex relationships between teams.
      
      - **Compare GMM results with K-means to identify consistent groupings**: By comparing the results of both methods, we can ensure that the clusters are reliable and stable across different approaches, giving deeper insights into team similarities.
      
      ##### Hierarchical Clustering:
      - **Perform agglomerative clustering to create a dendrogram of team similarities**: This method groups teams in a tree-like structure, making it easier to see how similar teams are to one another at different levels of granularity.
      
      - **Use this to identify both broad tactical families and subtle stylistic differences**: By analyzing the hierarchical tree, we can spot both large groupings of similar teams and more nuanced differences between closely related teams.
  
   #### 2. Techniques used for: Player-Team Compatibility Analysis
      ##### Similarity Metrics:
      - **Develop a cosine similarity measure between player attributes and team playing styles**: Cosine similarity will be used to quantify how closely a player's attributes (e.g., passing, shooting, defending) align with the tactical style of a team, allowing us to find players who fit the team's playing strategy.
        
      - **Create a compatibility score that considers both player skills and team tactical needs**: A weighted compatibility score will combine the cosine similarity of player attributes with specific team requirements, such as a need for strong defensive or offensive players, to ensure a more tailored fit for the team's tactical goals.
      
      ##### Optimization Algorithm:
      - **Implement a greedy algorithm to select the best players for a given team based on player-team style compatibility**: The greedy algorithm will iteratively pick the best available player for the team by maximizing the player-team compatibility score, ensuring that the players chosen complement the team‚Äôs tactical style.
      
      - **Player performance metrics**: The algorithm will factor in recent player performance data, such as goals scored or defensive actions, to prioritize high-performing players in key areas that the team requires.
      
      - **Positional needs of the team**: The selection will also account for the team‚Äôs positional needs, ensuring that the chosen players fill gaps in the lineup and balance the squad based on the team's formation and tactical approach.



4. Method 3: Integration of Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning
   <p align="justify">
   We aim to utilize machine learning techniques for clustering teams based on playing style, selecting matchups between teams from different clusters, identifying optimal players for a given matchup, and predicting the outcome of the match using historical data. Develop a system by combining unsupervised learning (K-means clustering), supervised learning (Random Forest classifier), and heuristic methods (player selection based on opponent characteristics), which would offer a sophisticated approach to team and player analysis.
   </p>
   
#### Steps:
1. Clustering Teams Based on Playing Style: We will first extract team playing style features from the available dataset, which may include:
   * **Offensive metrics**: Goals scored, shots on target, passing accuracy in the attacking third, etc.
   * **Defensive metrics**: Tackles made, interceptions, clearances, etc.
   * **Possession metrics**: Time in possession, passes completed, and ball retention.
   * **Form**: A measure of the team's performance in recent matches.         
      These features will be normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniformity across different ranges of metrics. After normalizing the data, **K-means clustering** will be applied to group teams into clusters based on their playing style. The clustering result will provide a set of groups where each group (cluster) represents teams with similar playing styles.
     
2. Visualizing Clusters:To visualize the results, we will apply t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to reduce the dimensionality of the playing style features, allowing us to plot teams in a 2D space. Each point will represent a team, and the color will represent its cluster.
3. Selecting Teams to Play Against Each Other: To ensure diversity in matchups, we will randomly select two teams from different clusters. This ensures that teams with varying playing styles are chosen for the simulated match.
4. Finding Best Players Based on Opponent: We will implement a system that identifies the best players for one team based on how well they can counter the playing style of the opposing team. This will involve comparing the playing styles of both teams and identifying which players from the opponent's squad are best suited to exploit the weaknesses of the first team.
  5. Predicting Match Outcome: Using historical match data, we will train a Random Forest classifier to predict the outcome of a match based on the playing styles (clusters) of both teams and their recent form. This will allow us to predict the likely outcome and the probabilities of each team winning.

#### Tools and Technologies:
   - üêç **Python Libraries**: Scikit-learn (for K-means clustering, t-SNE, Random Forest), Pandas, Matplotlib
   - ü§ñ **Machine Learning Algorithms**: K-means clustering, t-SNE for visualization, Random Forest classifier for match prediction
   - üìä **Data**: Team statistics (playing style), player statistics, and historical match data

## (Potential) Results and Discussion
This project would employ both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze football teams and the players. Our integrated system would cluster teams by playing styles, simulating matchups, identifying optimal players for a particular match-up, and predicting match outcomes using machine learning models. 

### ‚úÖ 3+ Quantitative Metrics
1. **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Our goal would be to achieve an ARI score of 0.6 or higher, which would be indicative of a meaningful correspondence between the clusters of playing styles and any available ground truth data.
2. **Homogeneity Score**: We aim to achieve a homogeneity score of 0.7 or higher, which would ensure that teams within each cluster exhibits consistent playing styles.
3. **Accuracy (Supervised Learning)**: We expect an accuracy of 75% or higher when predicting match outcomes using supervised learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines.
4. **Fowlkes-Mallows Index**: We aim to target an FMI score of 0.6 or higher which would ensure balanced precision and recall in our clustering results, which would in turn indicate that the clusters represent both true positives and true negatives effectively.
5. **Cross-Validation Score**: Using cross-validation for supervised learning, we aim to achieve an accuracy of at least 70% ensuring model robustness across different subsets. 

### ‚úÖ Project Goals
- Our project aims to accurately group football teams based on their playing styles. By clustering teams, we plan to uncover patterns and similarities that would help coaches and analysts devise more effective game strategies. We would also aim to optimize player selection by matching player attributes to the characteristics of the opponents, which would in turn improve a team‚Äôs tactical response to different playing styles.
- In addition, we also aim to predict match outcomes using different models we aim to implement. The insights gained would assist teams in preparing for upcoming matches with greater precision, utilizing data-driven decisions to optimize player performance and overall strategy.
- Our sustainability goal would focus on minimizing the reliance on extensive manual analysis and scouting by providing detailed data-driven insights that would streamline preparation resource allocation. We would also aim to ensure the model remains ethically sound by treating all teams fairly, focusing solely on objective performance metrics and avoiding biases that could disadvantage smaller clubs or low-budget teams. 

### ‚úÖ Expected Results
- We expect to be able to identify distinct clusters of teams with similar playing styles, such as high-pressing or possession-based strategies. This clustering would offer actionable insights for coaches to tailor their tactics for different matchups. Additionally, our system would also aim to optimize player selection based on opponent characteristics, which would ensure that the best players are chosen to counter specific styles of play.
- Our prediction models should achieve at least 75% accuracy in predicting match outcomes. This would help teams make more informed decisions during the preparation of games. We also expect the clustering to highlight tactical trends that would correlate with success, providing teams with deeper insights into how different playing styles interact and evolve over time.
