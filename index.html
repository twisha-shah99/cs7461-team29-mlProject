    <h1>AI ON THE PITCH: OPTIMIZING PLAYER SELECTION IN SOCCER</h1>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning can be applied to sports analytics to get insights to improve a team's performance. Since traditional approaches rely on subjective judgements, optimizing team performance through a data-driven approach becomes crucial.
            
           </p>
        
        <h3>Literature Review</h3>
        <p>
            Recent studies have used machine learning to address team formation and player selection. Unsupervised methods like GMMs and K-means cluster teams based on goals, and supervised learning helps identify optimal team compositions.
        </p>

        <h3>Dataset Description</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Soccer teams play using various styles; however, optimizing these strategies and choosing the best players for a particular opponent can be a difficult task. Rather than using a data-driven approach to cluster teams, coaches oftern rely on subjective judgements that an lead to poor team performance in games.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>Automating the analysis of teams to explore the best playing styles can allow teams to make better and strategic decisions. Using unsupervised learning to cluster teams based on tactics and supervised learning to predict match outcomes, this project will provide concrete insights to help teams to best select their players and strategy.</p>     
    </div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Methods</h2>

<!-- <p>Present proposed solutions, including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, elaborating on their effectiveness. Identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.</p> -->

<h3>Data Preprocessing Methods Identified</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis to find important features</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Feature Engineering - to make relevant combinations of features</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction</strong></li>
    </ol>

<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>  

    <ol>
        Using K-means, we will cluster teams based on their playing styles. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using the elbow method with t-SNE being used for cluster visualization. To capture the finer team details, we will use GMMs for flexible clustering and Hierarchical Clustering for multi-level similarity analysis.
        <br>
        <li><strong>Method 1: K-Means + GMM</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Method 2: Hierarchial Clustering</strong></li>
    </ol>
    
<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>  
   
<ol>
    We hope to create a classification system based on the StatsBomb dataset. Using ensemble methods including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, we hope to categorize players by role. By analyzing features such as physical attributes, technical skills, tactical awareness, and performance statistics, we aim to enhance tactical analysis and understand player dynamics within teams.
  <li><strong>Method 1: SVM</strong>
      <a href="#reference3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Method 2: Random Forest</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Method 3: Gradient Boost</strong></li>

<h3>Integrating Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</h3>  
    <p>This integrated approach combines clustering techniques to identify team playing styles with supervised learning methods for player classification and performance evaluation. By merging these analyses, we create a comprehensive system that can assess how well individual players fit into specific team compositions and predict potential match outcomes when considering lineup changes or transfers. </p>


</ol>
    
<!-- <ol>
  <li><strong>Method 1: Supervised Learning</strong></li>
    <p>We are pursuing three main objectives: player transfer evaluation, player performance prediction, and shot outcome prediction. The Player Transfer Evaluation System uses supervised learning to assess transfer success by analyzing player stats, team metrics, and transfer details. A Random Forest Classifier predicts transfer success, a Gradient Boosting Machine forecasts performance improvements, and an SVM classifies transfers as good or poor fits. For shot outcome prediction, models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest predict goal likelihood based on shot features. Lastly, player performance prediction employs a Gradient Boosting Regressor to forecast ratings based on recent form and opponent strength.</p>
  
  <li><strong>Method 2: Unsupervised Learning:</strong></li>
    <p>We aim to use unsupervised learning for two key objectives: team clustering and player-team compatibility analysis. For team clustering, K-means clustering will group teams by playing styles using features like goals scored, tackles, and possession. The elbow method will help find the optimal number of clusters, and t-SNE will be used to visualize the clusters. We will also implement Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for more flexible clustering, allowing teams to belong to multiple clusters, and use Hierarchical Clustering to explore broad and nuanced team similarities.
For player-team compatibility, we will develop a cosine similarity measure to quantify how well a player‚Äôs skills align with a team's tactical needs. A compatibility score will combine this similarity with team-specific requirements. To select the best players, a greedy algorithm will maximize compatibility while considering recent performance and positional needs.</p>
  <li><strong>Method 3: Integration of Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning</strong></li>
  <p>
    We aim to utilize machine learning techniques for clustering teams based on playing style, selecting matchups between teams from different clusters, identifying optimal players for a given matchup, and predicting the outcome of the match using historical data. Develop a system by combining unsupervised learning (K-means clustering), supervised learning (Random Forest classifier), and heuristic methods (player selection based on opponent characteristics), which would offer a sophisticated approach to team and player analysis.

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>The project aims to group soccer teams by their playing styles to provide insights on improving strategies. Moreover, we hope to optimize player selection based on the opposition and predict outcomes to reduce the subjective decision making and provide new strategies backed by data.</p>

    <h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>We hope to identify clusters of teams with similar playing styles offering insights to coaches to devise new strategies.
    Our system will also player selection based off their opposition. We also hope to predict match outcomes with a 75% accuracy. Additionally, 
     clustering should reveal trends that lead to success
      providing insights into how playing styles evolve.</p>
