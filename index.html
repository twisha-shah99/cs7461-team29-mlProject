    <h3>Problem Definition</h3>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>Football teams play using various styles; however, optimizing these strategies and choosing the best players for a particular opponent can be a difficult task. Rather than using a data-driven approach to cluster teams, coaches often rely on subjective judgments that can lead to poor team performance in games.</p>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>Automating the analysis of teams to explore the best playing styles can allow teams to make better and more strategic decisions. Using unsupervised learning to cluster teams based on tactics and supervised learning to predict match outcomes, this project will provide concrete insights to help teams select their players and strategy better. This, in turn, will help teams prepare better for games and improve performance.</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>

    <h4>Data Preprocessing Methods</h4>
    <p>Present proposed solutions, including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, elaborating on their effectiveness.</p>

    <h5>Unsupervised Learning: Team Clustering</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>K-means Clustering</li>
        <li>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)</li>
        <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Player-Team Compatibility Analysis</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Cosine Similarity</li>
        <li>Optimization Algorithm</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(Potential) Results and Discussion</h3>
    <p>This project would employ both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze football teams and players. Our integrated system would cluster teams by playing styles, simulate matchups, identify optimal players for a particular match-up, and predict match outcomes using machine learning models.</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Metrics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)</li>
        <li>Homogeneity Score</li>
        <li>Accuracy (Supervised Learning)</li>
        <li>Fowlkes-Mallows Index</li>
        <li>Cross-Validation Score</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
    <p>Our project aims to accurately group football teams based on their playing styles. By clustering teams, we plan to uncover patterns and similarities that will help coaches and analysts devise more effective game strategies.</p>
