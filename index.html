        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
        <p>The application of machine learning in sports analytics has gained significant momentum, offering coaches, analysts, and teams actionable insights to improve performance. In soccer, understanding and optimizing team strategies, player selection, and match outcomes is critical for success. Traditional approaches often rely on subjective judgments, which may lead to suboptimal decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>Literature Review</h3>
        <p>Recent studies have applied machine learning techniques to address challenges in soccer, such as optimizing team strategies and player selection. Unsupervised methods, like K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), have been used to cluster teams based on statistical features such as goals and possession, grouping them by similar tactical styles. Supervised learning techniques, including Random Forest classifiers, have been employed to predict match outcomes using historical data. These approaches help automate the analysis of teams and players, providing data-driven insights to improve team performance by enabling better strategic decisions and more effective player selection for specific matchups.</p>

        <h3>Dataset Description</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Events Data:</strong> Contains over 3 million events from around 7,000 matches, each tagged with event types like passes, shots, ball recoveries, and more, along with detailed location information.</li>
            <li><strong>Matches Data:</strong> Information about the matches themselves, including teams, scores, and dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Lineups Data:</strong> Details on players' positions, including their minutes played and substitutions during matches.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze Frame Data:</strong> Positional data for players at key moments, such as when a shot is taken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More documentation about the meaning of different events and the format of the JSON can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/tree/master/doc">documentation directory</a>.</p>

        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Football teams play using various styles; however, optimizing these strategies and choosing the best players for a particular opponent can be a difficult task. Rather than using a data-driven approach to cluster teams, coaches often rely on subjective judgments that can lead to poor team performance in games.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>Automating the analysis of teams to explore the best playing styles can allow teams to make better and strategic decisions. Using unsupervised learning to cluster teams based on tactics and supervised learning to predict match outcomes, this project will provide concrete insights to help teams to best select their players and strategy. This, in turn, will help teams better prepare for their games and enhance their performance in games.</p>
